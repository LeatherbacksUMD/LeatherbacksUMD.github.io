Named after it's creator, ALEXWANG is one of the most theatening one pounder robots in club, with it's enormous weapon posing a hazard to other bots as well as itself. Able to deal massive damage with a single blow, it's low slung blade is especially suited to damaging the undersides of bots, and even ripping wheels right off. Due to this power, it tends to have chaotic fits of bouncing around the arena, making it one of the more flambouyant bots to compete in UMD Leatherbacks SCR@M competitions!
