A relatively new bot to club, Sideapple utilizes a devasting overhead hammer with a spinning blade in order to smash through weak top armor and puncture critical components. Made of a mostly 3/8" aluminum frame, it's capable of taking a beating from horizontal and vertical spinners while keeping it's weapon safely behind it ready to swing forward and counterattack. It also features a powerful drive system in order to manuever around opponents and keep it's weapon at optimal striking distance. While it didn't stand out in bracket at the March 18th NHRL competition, all systems worked as expected and you can expect to see an improved version of this bot at future events!
