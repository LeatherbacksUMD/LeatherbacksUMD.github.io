One of the oldest running bots in club, Pinevictus sports two spinning vertical discs and a versatile 4WD allowing it to easily outmanuever competitors to deliver destructive uppercuts. It's proven to be a tough bot, with it's UHMW and TPU frame allowing it to take just as much damage as it can dish out. It's been competing in some form or another in more competitions than almost any other UMD Leatherbacks bot. You can be sure to see it at any event we attend!
