        <p> Combat Robotics is a sport dating back to 1994 where the goal is to disable the opposing robot(s)
            physically.
            With this seemingly simple task in mind, teams are challenged to design machines that balance dealing damage
            with protecting against damage. Constrained by weight, this sport embodies challenges that engineers face
            throughout the entirety of the design process. Robot Combat events are held around the world and versions of
            the
            sport have been featured on popular TV shows like Battlebots and Robot Wars. Combat robotics is a sport that
            has
            no right answer, but tough consequences for a wrong answer. As in their future engineering careers,
            organization
            members will be challenged to make risky decisions and collaborate to create the most destructive machine,
            as
            well as adapt to rapidly changing situations. This hands-on education is crucial to any student because it
            gives
            an all inclusive experience of the design and manufacturing processes.
