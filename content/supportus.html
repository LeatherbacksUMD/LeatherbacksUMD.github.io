    past experience. Not only do members become part of a large, familial team, they learn specific real-world STEM related 
    skills. If you are interested in joining us, you can email us at 
    <a href="mailto:leatherbacks.umd@gmail.com">leatherbacks.umd@gmail.com</a> and join our <a href=https://discord.gg/TJsdgHt4bf>Discord</a>

<h5>Sponsors</h5>

    Our sponsors help us stay afloat in the always competitive world of robotics. The required budget for teams 
    is growing every year, so sponsors are becoming more and more important. Their support can range from monetary donations 
    to providing us with tools and materials. If your company is willing to provide us with 
    money, parts, tools, or anything else, feel free to contact us at
